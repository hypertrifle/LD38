##PLAY

## TIPS

Players must start by gaining fuel for their fist by collecting the yellow orbs on the planet, once your fist has enough power (indicated by the power bar on the wrist), you are able to move it, and punch (press both left and right fist buttons together).

Try dashing through your opponent to dizzy them while you manoeuvre you fist to smash them.

First player to smash the other player 5 times wins! (indicated by the coloured HUD inside the world.)

ESC to return to the menu.
